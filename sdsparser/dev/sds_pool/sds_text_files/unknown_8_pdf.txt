SECTION 4FIRST AID MEASURESINHALATIONImmediately remove from further exposure.  Get immediate medical assistance.  For those providing assistance, avoid exposure to yourself or others.  Use adequate respiratory protection.  Give supplemental oxygen, if available.  If breathing has stopped, assist ventilation with a mechanical device.SKIN CONTACTWash contact areas with soap and water.  Remove contaminated clothing.  Launder contaminated clothing before reuse.EYE CONTACTFlush thoroughly with water.  If irritation occurs, get medical assistance.INGESTIONFirst aid is normally not required. Seek medical attention if discomfort occurs.SECTION 5FIRE FIGHTING MEASURESEXTINGUISHING MEDIAAppropriate Extinguishing Media:  Use water fog, foam, dry chemical or carbon dioxide (CO2) to extinguish flames.Inappropriate Extinguishing Media:  Straight Streams of WaterFIRE FIGHTINGFire Fighting Instructions:  Evacuate area.  Prevent runoff from fire control or dilution from entering streams, sewers, or drinking water supply.  Firefighters should use standard protective equipment and in enclosed spaces, self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).  Use water spray to cool fire exposed surfaces and to protect personnel.   Product Name:   NEODECANOIC ACID, PRIME Revision Date:  20 Jul 2018 Page 3 of 10 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Hazardous Combustion Products:   Incomplete combustion products, Oxides of carbon, Smoke, FumeFLAMMABILITY PROPERTIES Flash Point [Method]:  122°C  (252°F)  [ASTM D-92]Flammable Limits (Approximate volume % in air):  LEL:  N/D     UEL:  N/DAutoignition Temperature:   440°C  (824°F) SECTION 6ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURESNOTIFICATION PROCEDURESIn the event of a spill or accidental release, notify relevant authorities in accordance with all applicable regulations. US regulations  require reporting releases of this material to the environment which exceed the applicable reportable quantity or oil spills which could reach any waterway including intermittent dry creeks. The National Response Center can be reached at (800)424-8802.PROTECTIVE MEASURESAvoid contact with spilled material.  Warn or evacuate occupants in surrounding and downwind areas if required due to toxicity or flammability of the material.  See Section 5 for fire fighting information.  See the Hazard Identification Section for Significant Hazards.  See Section 4 for First Aid Advice.  See Section 8 for advice on the minimum requirements for personal protective equipment. Additional protective measures may be necessary, depending on the specific circumstances and/or the expert judgment of the emergency responders. SPILL MANAGEMENTLand Spill:  Stop leak if you can do it without risk.  Do not touch or walk through spilled material.  Use clean non-sparking tools to collect absorbed material.  Absorb or cover with dry earth, sand or other non-combustible material and transfer to containers.  Recover by pumping or with suitable absorbent.Water Spill:  Stop leak if you can do it without risk.  Confine the spill immediately with booms.  Warn other shipping.  Remove from the surface by skimming or with suitable absorbents.  Seek the advice of a specialist before using dispersants.Water spill and land spill recommendations are based on the most likely spill scenario for this material; however, geographic conditions, wind, temperature, (and in the case of a water spill) wave and current direction and speed may greatly influence the appropriate action to be taken.  For this reason, local experts should be consulted.  Note:  Local regulations may prescribe or limit action to be taken.ENVIRONMENTAL PRECAUTIONSLarge Spills:  Dike far ahead of liquid spill for later recovery and disposal.  Prevent entry into waterways, sewers, basements or confined areas. SECTION 7HANDLING AND STORAGEHANDLINGAvoid contact with skin.  Use proper bonding and/or ground procedures.  However, bonding and grounds may not eliminate the hazard from static accumulation. Prevent small spills and leakage to avoid slip hazard. DO NOT handle, store or open near an open flame, sources of heat or sources of ignition. Protect material from direct sunlight. Product Name:   NEODECANOIC ACID, PRIME Revision Date:  20 Jul 2018 Page 4 of 10 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Loading/Unloading Temperature:     [Ambient]Transport Temperature:     [Ambient] Transport Pressure:     [Ambient]Static Accumulator:   This material is not a static accumulator.STORAGEStore in a cool, dry place with adequate ventilation.

Control measures to consider: Adequate ventilation should be provided so that exposure limits are not exceeded.PERSONAL PROTECTION Personal protective equipment selections vary based on potential exposure conditions such as applications, handling practices, concentration and ventilation.  Information on the selection of protective equipment for use with this material, as provided below, is based upon intended, normal usage. Respiratory Protection:   If engineering controls do not maintain airborne contaminant concentrations at a level which is adequate to protect worker health, an approved respirator may be appropriate.  Respirator selection, use, and maintenance must be in accordance with regulatory requirements, if applicable.  Types of respirators to be considered for this material include: Half-face filter respirator Product Name:   NEODECANOIC ACID, PRIME Revision Date:  20 Jul 2018 Page 5 of 10 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________For high airborne concentrations, use an approved supplied-air respirator, operated in positive pressure mode.  Supplied air respirators with an escape bottle may be appropriate when oxygen levels are inadequate, gas/vapor warning properties are poor, or if air purifying filter capacity/rating may be exceeded.Hand Protection:   Any specific glove information provided is based on published literature and glove manufacturer data.  Glove suitability and breakthrough time will differ depending on the specific use conditions. Contact the glove manufacturer for specific advice on glove selection and breakthrough times for your use conditions. Inspect and replace worn or damaged gloves. The types of gloves to be considered for this material include: If prolonged or repeated contact is likely, chemical resistant gloves are recommended.  If contact with forearms is likely, wear gauntlet style gloves.Eye Protection:   If contact is likely, safety glasses with side shields are recommended.Skin and Body Protection:    Any specific clothing information provided is based on published literature or manufacturer data.  The types of clothing to be considered for this material include: If prolonged or repeated contact is likely, chemical, and oil resistant clothing is recommended.Specific Hygiene Measures:   Always observe good personal hygiene measures, such as washing after handling the material and before eating, drinking, and/or smoking.
