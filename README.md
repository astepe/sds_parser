## sds_parser
sds_parser is a browser-based app for extracting chemical data from Safety Data Sheet documents. sds_parser will speed up your
data-entry process by eliminating the need to read through Safety Data Sheets to get the data you care about.

## Motivation
Built out of the need to quickly access chemical data from Safety Data Sheets for data-entry purposes. Each chemical manufacturer will stylize and structure their SDSs a little bit differently. sds_parser can easily be updated to read a new manufacturer format by adding a new set of regular expressions to match the format that that specific manufacturer uses.

## Tech/framework used
* [pdfminer](https://github.com/euske/pdfminer), a tool for extracting information from PDF documents
* [pytesseract](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/), a python wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR

## Features
Have some physical SDSs you need to scan and get data from? Have no fear, sds_parser will recognize your scanned file as an image and perform optical character recognition to extract the text for you. 

## How to use?
Simply initialize `SDSParser` with an optional list of data fields you wish to extract (e.g. ['manufacturer', 'flash_point']) to `request_keys`. See `configs.SDSRegexes.SDS_DATA_TITLES` for the proper keys to use. If no keys are requested, all available data fields will be searched.
```
sds_parser = SDSParser(**request_keys=<[keys]>)
```
then call `.get_sds_data()` to retrieve the matches by passing in your SDS document in `.pdf` format. If you wish to turn off automatic ocr functionality, do that here with `ocr_override=False`.
```
chemical_data = sds_parser.get_sds_data(file_path, ocr_override=False)
```
`chemical_data` will be a dictionary object mapping request key names to their corresponding matches. If the specific field is not found in the SDS, `.get_sds_data()` will return the string 'Data not listed'. If the field is found, but no data is found under it, `.get_sds_data()` will return the string 'No data available'.
